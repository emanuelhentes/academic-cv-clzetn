## About Me

I am a PhD Candidate at the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, Utrecht University. My research focuses on education and makes use of administrative data and quasi-experimental statistical methods to provide causal evidence. This PhD project is carried out as part of the larger EU-funded [EFFEct project](https://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/LEER/effect-project/effect-team) (Enhancing Efficiency and Effectiveness in Education). I am currently working on my second paper about the relationship between adult education and labor market outcomes.

*Supervisors*: [Dr. Deni Mazrekaj](https://denimazrekaj.com/) (daily supervisor) and [Prof. Dr. Tanja van der Lippe](https://www.uu.nl/staff/tvanderlippe)
